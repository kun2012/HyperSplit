# HyperSplit

HyperSplit is the implementation of paper [Packet Classification Algorithms:
From Theory to Practice](http://security.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/share/infocom09-hypersplit.pdf).

Original source code is provided by the authors.

Throughput test is added by Kun as marked.

# Usage
./hs filter_set_file trace_file

# Comments
Due to the experiment, HyperSplit is the fastest decision-tree based packet classification algorithm, even faster than the most recent [Compressedcut](https://github.com/kun2012/compressedcut).
